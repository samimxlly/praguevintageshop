# Vinted profile sync (GitHub Pages)

This project scrapes a public Vinted profile and displays products on a static GitHub Pages site.

**IMPORTANT**: This scraper is intended for personal/local use only. Scraping websites may violate their Terms of Service. Use responsibly and avoid aggressive polling.

## Live Site

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at: `https://[username].github.io/praguevintageshop`

## How it works

1. A GitHub Actions workflow (`scrape-and-commit.yml`) runs every 3 minutes to scrape the Vinted profile
2. The scraped data is committed to `products.json` in the repository
3. Another workflow (`deploy-github-pages.yml`) automatically deploys the static site to GitHub Pages
4. The frontend (`index.html`) fetches and displays products from `products.json`

## Setup

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. The site will be automatically deployed on every push to the main branch

### Local Development

1. Install Node.js (v16+ recommended)
2. In the project folder run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm start
```

This starts a local server on http://localhost:3000 for testing. The frontend (`index.html`) will fetch `/api/products` from the server.

### Open index.html directly

You can also open `index.html` directly in a browser. It will load products from `products.json` in the same directory, simulating the GitHub Pages environment.

## Notes and limitations

- The scraper in `scraper.js` parses the current public HTML on Vinted and looks for links containing `/items/`
- Vinted markup or anti-scraping measures may change; this code may require adjustments
- Images are loaded directly from Vinted CDN URLs
- A GitHub Actions workflow runs every 3 minutes to re-sync the profile
- The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and updates automatically when `products.json` changes

## Architecture

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated scraping workflow that updates product data
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the static frontend
- **Static files**: `index.html` (frontend), `products.json` (product data)
- **No server required**: Everything runs as static files on GitHub Pages
